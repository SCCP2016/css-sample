                    <p>This section is not normative. CSS 2.1 defined four layout modes — algorithms which determine the size
                        and position of boxes based on their relationships with their sibling and ancestor boxes: block layout,
                        designed for laying out documents inline layout, designed for laying out text table layout, designed
                        for laying out 2D data in a tabular format positioned layout, designed for very explicit positioning
                        without much regard for other elements in the document This module introduces a new layout mode,
                        flex layout, which is designed for laying out more complex applications and webpages.</p>
